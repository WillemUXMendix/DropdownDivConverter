## Description

The DropdownDivConverter converts a Mendix (div-)container into a - Bootstrap based - dropdown menu with a button. Simply create a container in Mendix with all the content you want in the dropdown menu and the DropdownDivConverter widget as it's last child. Everything you will have added then becomes the content of the dropdown menu.

## Special Split button settings

The split button is a special button combination in Bootstrap: it offers a primary button and pasted onto it a dropdown button offering access to the dropdown menu.
The DropdownDivConverter widget offers two ways of adding behaviour to the primary button:

1. Use a simple microflow without a needed entity: use the Simple Microflow setting and leave the Microflow setting empty.

2. Use a microflow with an entity as it's parameter: use the Microflow and Context object setting to accomplish this.


Note that 'Dropdown button label'-setting will now be used for the label on the primary button instead.

## Implementation steps

1. Create a container element with all the contents needed in the dropdown menu (including any needed logic).
2. Add the DropdownDivConverter widget as the container's last child.
3. Change the widget settings to accomodate for the wanted behaviour / appearance.

## Notes
It's possible to use multiple DropdownDivConverter widgets on the same page. That does mean that the dropdown-menu will be included in the normal HTML contents of the Mendix application. Sometimes this will have the effect that a dataview e.g. does not accomodate any space for the dropdown menu itself. Use the css propery "overflow: visible" to solve this issue.

Since the dropdown menu is based on bootstraps dropdown button it is recommended to follow the applications Bootstrap theming rules with respect to buttons.
